# YTTranscriptionProcessing Manifesto

The primary goal of `YTTranscriptionProcessing` agency is to enable seamless transcription of YouTube videos, allowing users to obtain accurate and timely transcriptions based on their input sources.

## Workflow
1. **User Input**: The user provides the URL of a YouTube video they want transcribed.
2. **TranscriptionAgent**: The TranscriptionAgent is responsible for processing the user's input, selecting the appropriate transcription tool, and generating the transcription.
3. **Results/Error Handling**: After processing, the system will either return a success message indicating `Transcription completed successfully` or handle any errors encountered during the process. Do not return the transcription text directly to avoid hallucination and unnecessary costs.

4. **Post-Transcription Interaction**: After informing the user about the success of the transcription, the system will prompt the user with the following questions:
   - "Would you like to find the time where a particular context is discussed in the video?"
   - "Would you like to generate a summary to post on any social media?"
   - "Do you want to perform Q&A from this transcript?"

## Error Handling
- **Error Notification**: Do not attempt to resolve errors. Notify the user with an appropriate error message if the transcription fails.

## Components

Each component within YTTranscriptionProcessing plays a crucial role in achieving the goal of accurate and efficient transcription:
